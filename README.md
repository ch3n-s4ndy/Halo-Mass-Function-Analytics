# Cosmological Parameters, Predictions, and Dark Matter: A Dive into Halo Mass Function Analytics
Welcome to my summer research project on dark matter. This repository provides a collection of Python notebooks that dive deep into analytics of the halo mass function with an emphasis on the effects of various cosmological parameters and performing analytical fits.
## Notebooks:
### power_spectrum.ipynb
This notebook is dedicated to generating power spectrums. It highlights how varying cosmological parameters can impact the power spectrums.
### transfer_to_hmf.ipynb
Provides a guide on how to obtain the transfer function using CLASS and input it into halomod to generate the halo mass function.
### hmf_thermal_relic.ipynb
Generates a series of thermal relic warm dark matter halo mass functions.
### hmf_sigma8.ipynb
This notebook serves a dual purpose. Firstly, it demonstrates how sigma8 affects the halo mass function and the transfer function. Secondly, it shows how different parameters impact the halo mass function.
### hmf_fitting.ipynb
This notebook is centered on performing an arctan-based fitting on the halo mass function for different dark matter models, such as the cold dark matter model, thermal relic warm dark matter model, and the mixed dark matter model.
## Dependencies:
